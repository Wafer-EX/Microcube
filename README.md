# Microcube (Demo)
This is a simple game that is a clone of the EDGE (by Mobigame) where you rolls a cube to finish. It was made from scratch using OpenGL. (Silk.NET bindings.)

### What's the goal?
It was just an experiment to me like a challenge, it's not pretend to be a real game and shouldn't uploaded to places like Play Market, App Store and etc. This game include basic implementation of common things and was planned as example for me, how I can make a game from scratch, and to get some experience. So this game doesn't has any licence, i.e. all rights are reserved.

### Implemented things:
- Levels
- Sprites
- Texture atlases (include fonts)
- UI system
### Screenshots

| Main menu | Level selection |

| The play button just shows next screen (level selection) and the Exit button closes app. | Include level list that is parsed from `Resources/levels` folder with their names. When button is clicked, the level opens. |
